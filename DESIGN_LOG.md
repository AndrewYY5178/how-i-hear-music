# How I Hear Music — Design Log

Append one entry for every visual version. Never rewrite an earlier entry; corrections become a new version.

| Version | Date | Scope | Reference | Commit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1 | 2026-08-29 | Album catalog rhythm, interaction and motion standard | Album of the Year; Music Memory; The Listening Log content model | `Add UI design versioning baseline` |
| 1.2 | 2026-08-29 | Journal reading hierarchy and module color stability | Music Memory | `Standardize journal reading hierarchy` |

## Version 1.1 — Catalog rhythm and interaction baseline

### Before

- Album cards had correct square artwork but variable title/link baselines.
- Cover fallback visibility depended on the browser's default `[hidden]` rule.
- Hover movement existed without a repository-level reduced-motion contract.
- Design decisions were spread across TODO notes and commit history.

### Decision

- Preserve the existing editorial identity and module palette.
- Standardize album cards as a repeated 1:1 catalog system with aligned metadata and actions.
- Add explicit focus, touch and reduced-motion behavior.
- Correct the mobile album grid cascade so 390px layouts use two columns rather than three.
- Establish `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, this append-only log, and per-reference Taste DNA files.

### Evidence

- Album of the Year uses repeated square covers and fixed metadata order to support rapid catalog scanning.
- Music Memory frames listening history as dated personal narrative rather than a generic activity feed.
- The Listening Log confirms the usefulness of chronological listening notes, though its live page was unavailable to the isolated visual-analysis browser during this pass.

### Files

- `styles.css`
- `modules/archive/pages.js`
- `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
- `DESIGN_LOG.md`
- `albumoftheyear.org.md`
- `albumoftheyear.org.json`

### Verification

- Desktop review: four equal album columns at 1440 × 900, square covers and aligned metadata.
- Mobile review: two album columns at 390 × 844 with no fingerprint collision or horizontal overflow.
- Mobile metrics: 390px page width, two 171px columns, 16px column gap, 24px row gap, 1:1 cover ratio.
- One legacy remote cover closed its connection; the explicit fallback preserved the card frame as intended.
- Automated repository check: `npm test`.

## Version 1.2 — Journal memory hierarchy

### Before

- Saved track notes existed in local rating history but Journal omitted them.
- The empty Journal explained how entries appear without offering a direct next action.
- A 180ms page-color transition could briefly pair a new module's foreground colors with the previous module's background.

### Decision

- Put the entry title and saved listening note before quiet artist metadata; keep date, event type and score in stable side columns.
- Constrain listening notes to a 560px reading measure.
- Add one typographic route action to the empty state instead of adding a container or decoration.
- Make module material changes immediate so Rate never passes through a light low-contrast frame.

### Evidence

- Music Memory gives a remembered listening moment more typographic weight than its date and place.
- The captured landing page uses a 430px body measure beside a larger display statement, showing that narrative focus can come from width and scale rather than another card.
- Browser checks at 390 × 844 confirmed all four audited routes had the correct path, heading, module material, return action and no horizontal overflow; the earlier repeated Import captures were a rapid-capture artifact.

### Rejected transfers

- The orange accent, rounded floating memory cards, shadows, phone mockup and waitlist composition do not belong to this archive.
- Taste, Import and the settled Rate layout were intentionally left unchanged because their hierarchy and responsive measurements already passed.

### Files

- `modules/journal/pages.js`
- `styles.css`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
- `DESIGN_LOG.md`
- `musicmemory.app.md`
- `musicmemory.app.json`

### Verification

- Desktop and mobile Journal review for the empty state, plus an isolated seeded render check for populated note hierarchy.
- Mobile route audit for Journal, Taste, Rate and Import at 390 × 844.
- Automated repository check: `npm test`.
